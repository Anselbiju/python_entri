s = 14-7
d = 14/7
m = 14*7
print(a ,"addition")
print(s, "Substraction")
print(d, "Division")
print(m, "Multipication")

#4. Write Python code that displays the numbers from 1 to 5 as steps. 
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(' ' * (i - 1) + str(i))

#5. Write Python code that outputs the following sentence (including the quotation marks and line break) to the screen: 
print( """
"SDK" stands for "Software Development Kit", whereas \n
"IDE" stands for "Integrated Development Environment". 
""")

#6.Practice and check the output
print("python is an \"awesome\" language.")
print("python\n\t2023")
print('I\'m from Entri.\b')
print("\65")
print("\x65")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\n")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="\b")
print("Entri", "2023", sep="*", end="\b\b\b\b")


#7.Define the variables below. Print the types of each variable. What is the sum of your variables? (Hint: use a type conversion function.) What datatype is the sum?
num=23
textnum="57"
decimal=98.3
print(type(num),type(textnum),type(decimal))
sum = (num+int(textnum)+decimal)
print(sum,type(sum))

#8. calculate the number of minutes in a year using variables for each unit of time.
# print a statement that describes what your code does also.
# Create three variables to store no of days in a year, minute in a hour, 
# hours in a day, then calculate the total minutes in a year and print the values
#(hint) total number of minutes in an year =No.of days in an year * Hours in a day * Minutes in an hour
days_in_a_year = 365
minutes_in_an_hour = 60
hours_in_a_day = 24
total_minutes_in_a_year = days_in_a_year * hours_in_a_day * minutes_in_an_hour
print("The total number of minutes in a year.",total_minutes_in_a_year)

#9. Write Python code that asks the user to enter his/her name and then output/prints his/her name with a greeting.
greet = input("Enter you name :")
print("Hello",greet,"Welcome to Entri")

#10. Name your file: PoundsToDollars.py Write a program that asks the user to enter an amount in pounds (Â£) and the program calculates and converts an amount in dollar ($)
pound = int(input("enter the pound amount :"))
conversion_rate = 1.30  
dollars = pound * conversion_rate
print("The amount in dollar is : ",dollars)
